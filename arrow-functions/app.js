'use strict';

// STEP 1
// This is a standard function expression. You may also be familiar with function declarations, which begin with the "function" keyword.
const theOldWay = (course) => {
  return `I am currently enrolled in ${course}`;
};

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log('The old way:', theOldWay('Code 301'));


// STEP 2
// We can refactor our first function to use an arrow function.
// The word "function" is removed and an arrow is added in between the parameter and the opening curly brace
const theNewWay = (course) => {
  return `I am currently enrolled in ${course}`;
};

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log('The new way:', theNewWay('Code 301'));


// STEP 3
// When we have one parameter, we can omit the parentheses
const withoutParens = course => {
  return `I am currently enrolled in ${course}`;
};

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log('Without parens:', withoutParens('Code 301'));


// STEP 4
// If the code block contains a single line of code, we can write everything on one line
// We no longer need the curly braces and the return is implicit
// Without an arrow function, we need to explicitly type "return"
const oneLiner = course => `I cam currently enrolled in ${course}`;

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log('As a one-liner:', oneLiner('Code 301'));


// STEP 5
// What if we have multiple parameters?
// In a function expression, they all go in the parentheses
const add = (num1, num2) => {
  return `${num1} + ${num2} = ${num1 + num2}`;
};

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log('Let\'s do some math:', add(4, 5));


// STEP 6
// When we have multiple parameters, they must be wrapped in parentheses
// We can only remove the parentheses when there is a single parameter
const addOneLiner = (num1, num2) => `${num1} + ${num2} = ${num1 + num2}`;

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log('Add as a one-liner:', addOneLiner(4, 5));


// STEP 7
// What if we have multiple lines of code?
// We need to use a code block
const multiLiner = word => {
  word = word.toUpperCase();
  return word;
};

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log('Multi-line arrow function:', multiLiner('hello'));


// STEP 8
// The way an object is returned is different with an arrow function, too.
// Here is how we return an object without arrow functions
const oldObject = function(array) {
  return {
    firstValue: array[0],
    secondValue: array[1],
    thirdValue: array[2]
  };
};

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log('Hello from the old object function', oldObject(['hi', 'hello', 'are you there?']));


// STEP 9
// With an arrow function, we need to wrap our object in parentheses
// Otherwise, it will be interpreted as a code block
const newObject = array => ({
  firstValue: array[0],
  secondValue: array[1],
  thirdValue: array[2]
});

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log('Hello from the new object function', newObject(['hi', 'hello', 'are you there?']));


// STEP 10
// Uncomment the console.log lines to view the output of each function in the browser console.
// Refactor each function into an arrow function.
// Write your solutions on a single line wherever possible. 



const sum = (a, b, c, d) => a + b + c + d;

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4));


const objectLit = () => ({
  key1: 'value1',
  key2: 'value2',
  key3: 'value3',
});

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log(objectLit());


let sumAndProduct = (a, b) => {
  let sum = a + b;
  let product = a * b;
  return [sum, product];
};

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log(sumAndProduct(3, 9));


let message = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log(message('Allie'));


let Student = function (name, age, hometown)  {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.hometown = hometown;
};

let joe = new Student('Joe', 'Schmoe', 100);

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log(joe);


Student.prototype.greeting = function() {
  return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}`;
};

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log(joe.greeting());


Student.courseName = () => {
  return 'This student is enrolled in Code 301.';
};

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log(Student.courseName());



// STEP 11
// How do arrow functions affect constructor functions?
// the arrow function make the "this" reach for a global property/argument?  which makes it look for a the next highest container... which is this case is a window. either way because the console.log of joe.scope is undefined... think this is because joe has been set as local variable by let...but the quesiton is what is scope?

Student.prototype.scope = function () {
  (console.log(this));
};

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log(joe.scope());


Student.prototype.scopeArrow = function () { 
  console.log(this);
};

// DONE: Uncomment the following line of code to see the output in the browser console
console.log(joe.scopeArrow());

// DONE: Write a COMMENT below to answer the following questions.
// 1. What is "this" when joe.scope() is invoked?
//ANSWER: "this" is trying to refer to joe, but joe was set as a local variable by using "let" when it was defined. 
// 
// 2. What is "this" when joe.scopeArrow() is invoked?
//"this" in scoepArrow is invoked but because it is focused on this and let was how joe was defined it not able to call on the joe properites.
//
// 3. Explain why "this" is different when an arrow function is used.
// This is different in an arrow because it is looking for the top container, to have a "context" so it will look at the highest container and apply "this" to refer to the to container object name. in both cases it seems to be the top window.
